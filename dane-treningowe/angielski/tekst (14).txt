Lambda Aurigae (λ Aur, λ Aurigae) is the Bayer designation for a solar analog[9] star in the northern constellation of Auriga.[13] It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.71.[2] Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, it is approximately 41.2 light-years (12.6 parsecs) distant from the Earth.[1]

Description
This is a G-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of G1 V.[3] In terms of composition it is similar to the Sun, while the mass and radius are slightly larger.[6] It is 73% more luminous than the Sun[3] and radiates this energy from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 5890 K.[8] At this heat, the star glows with the yellow hue of a G-type star.[14] It has a low level of surface activity and is a candidate Maunder minimum analog.[15]

Lambda Aurigae has been examined for the presence of excess infrared emission that may indicate the presence of a circumstellar disk of dust, but no significant surplus has been observed.[9] It is a possible member of the Epsilon Indi Moving Group of stars that share a common motion through space. The space velocity components of this star are [U, V, W] = [+76, –39, –6] km/s.[16]

Name
Astronomy in China has a long history stretching from the Shang Dynasty, being refined over a period of more than 3,000 years. The Ancient Chinese people have identified stars from 1300BCE, as Chinese star names later categorized in the twenty-eight mansions have been found on oracle bones unearthed at Anyang, dating back to the mid-Shang Dynasty. The core of the "mansion" (xiù:宿) system also took shape around this period, by the time of King Wu Ding (1339–1281 BCE).[1]

Detailed records of astronomical observations began during the Warring States period (fourth century BCE) and flourished from the Han period onward. Chinese astronomy was equatorial, centered on close observation of circumpolar stars, and was based on different principles from those in traditional Western astronomy, where heliacal risings and settings of zodiac constellations formed the basic ecliptic framework.[2] Needham has described the ancient Chinese as the most persistent and accurate observers of celestial phenomena anywhere in the world before the Islamic astronomers.[3]
