Dreamsnake is a 1978 science fiction novel by American writer Vonda N. McIntyre. It is an expansion of her 1973 novelette "Of Mist, and Grass, and Sand", for which she won her first Nebula Award.[1][2] The story is set on Earth in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. The central character, Snake, is a healer who uses genetically modified serpents to cure sickness—one of these is the titular "dreamsnake", an alien serpent whose venom gives dying people pleasant dreams. The novel follows Snake as she seeks to replace her dreamsnake after its death.

The book is considered an example of second-wave feminism in science fiction. McIntyre subverted conventionally gendered narratives by rewriting a typical heroic quest to place a woman at its center, and by using devices such as avoiding gender pronouns to challenge expectations about characters' gender identities. Dreamsnake also explored varying social structures and sexual paradigms from a feminist perspective, and examined themes of healing and cross-cultural interaction.

The novel was well-received, winning the 1978 Nebula Award, the 1979 Hugo Award,[3] and the 1979 Locus Poll Award. The strength and self-sufficiency of Snake as a protagonist were noted by several commentators. Reviewers also praised McIntyre's writing and the book's themes. Scholar Diane Wood wrote that Dreamsnake demonstrated "science fiction's potential to produce aesthetic pleasure through experimentation with linguistic and cultural codes",[4] and Ursula K. Le Guin called it "a book like a mountain stream—fast, clean, clear, exciting, beautiful".[5]

Background and setting
In 1971, Vonda N. McIntyre, then living in Seattle, set up the Clarion West writers' workshop, which she helped run through 1973. One of the workshop's instructors was Ursula K. Le Guin.[6] During a 1972 workshop session, one of the writing assignments was to create a story from two randomly chosen words, one pastoral, and one related to technology. McIntyre's effort would become her 1973 short story "Of Mist, and Grass, and Sand". That story grew into Dreamsnake, and was used unchanged as the first chapter of the novel.[6] Two other pieces by McIntyre, "The Broken Dome" and "The Serpent's Death", both published in 1978, also constitute sections of the novel,[7] and it is described as a fix-up.[8] Dreamsnake, McIntyre's second novel, was released by Houghton Mifflin in 1978, with a cover illustration by Stephen Alexander.[9][10]

The story is set after a nuclear holocaust that "destroyed everyone who knew or cared about the reasons it had happened".[6][11] Most animal species are extinct, regions of the planet are radioactive, and the sky is hidden by dust.[12] Human society is depicted as existing in what journalist Sam Jordison describes as "low-tech tribalism": the character Arevin, for instance, has never seen a book.[13][14] The exception is the single city of Center, which has sophisticated technology and is in contact with other planets,[6][12][15] but which has a rigidly hierarchical structure and does not permit outsiders to enter.[16] The city also serves as the setting for McIntyre's first novel, The Exile Waiting (1975).[9][10] The protagonist of Dreamsnake is Snake, a healer who uses snake venom in her trade. She travels with three genetically engineered snakes; a rattlesnake, named Sand, a cobra, named Mist, and a "dreamsnake" named Grass, who is described as being from an alien world, and who relieves the pain of dying patients by letting them dream.[11][17]
