He died in hospital in Kitchener following a cardiac arrest.

By the arrangements of the Canadian federation, Canada's monarchy operates in Ontario as the core of the province's Westminster-style parliamentary democracy.[1] As such, the Crown within Ontario's jurisdiction may be referred to as the Crown in Right of Ontario,[2] Her Majesty in Right of Ontario,[3] the Queen in Right of Ontario,[4] or Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario.[5] The Constitution Act, 1867, however, leaves many functions in Ontario specifically assigned to the sovereign's viceroy, the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario,[1] whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy.[6]

The role of the Crown is both legal and practical; it functions in Ontario in the same way it does in all of Canada's other provinces, being the centre of a constitutional construct in which the institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority share the power of the whole.[7] It is thus the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the province's government.[8] The Canadian monarch—since  6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II—is represented and has her duties carried out by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, whose direct participation in governance is limited by the conventional stipulations of constitutional monarchy, with most related powers entrusted for exercise by the elected parliamentarians, the ministers of the Crown generally drawn from amongst them, and the judges and justices of the peace.[6] The Crown today primarily functions as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power.[6][9][10] This arrangement began with the 1867 British North America Act,[1] and continued an unbroken line of monarchical government extending back to the early 17th century. However, though Ontario has its own government, of which the Lieutenant Governor, as the Queen's representative, Ontario is not itself a kingdom.[11]
